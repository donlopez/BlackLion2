Here’s a suggested README file for your Black Lion IT capstone project:

Black Lion IT Capstone Project

Overview

The Black Lion Project is an IT capstone project developed as part of a college course, focused on backend development and cloud deployment. This project handles data management, database connectivity, and efficient deployment practices using AWS services.

Project Structure

This project uses a Node.js application containerized with Docker and deployed to AWS Fargate for scalable and managed container orchestration. The backend interacts with a MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS to ensure reliability and security for data storage and access.

Project Goals

The main objective of the Black Lion Project is to provide a robust backend infrastructure that handles requests effectively and ensures seamless communication with the database. The deployment is designed to utilize cloud resources efficiently, meeting performance and scalability demands.

Process and Implementation

	1.	Backend Development:
	•	Built using Node.js, the backend application handles all API requests, manages business logic, and establishes a connection to the RDS MySQL database.
	2.	Database Configuration:
	•	Set up Amazon RDS with MySQL for secure, managed database hosting.
	•	Configured database access and permissions to enable seamless communication with the Node.js application.
	3.	Containerization with Docker:
	•	The Node.js application is containerized using Docker to create a portable, consistent environment for deployment.
	•	Configured Docker to manage dependencies and ensure application consistency across different environments.
	4.	Deployment to AWS Fargate:
	•	Deployed the Docker container to AWS Fargate, allowing for a fully managed container orchestration service.
	•	Fargate manages the container lifecycle, including scaling and infrastructure management, reducing the need for manual maintenance.

Future Enhancements

	•	Implementing API Gateway with AWS Lambda to handle API requests.
	•	Adding monitoring and logging with AWS CloudWatch for enhanced operational insights.

Technologies Used

	•	Node.js for backend application development.
	•	MySQL on Amazon RDS for database management.
	•	Docker for containerization.
	•	AWS Fargate for managed container deployment.
